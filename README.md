# Revision

## About
A terminal-based quiz revision application, accepting human-readable text files containing either multiple-choice or short answer questions for users to answer in the application. At the end of the quiz, it will generate a report indicating topics that may need revision.

Created for the 24-hour hackathon TrojanHacks 2024.

## Usage
Run the executable `revision` with the name of the file containing the questions you want to be quizzed on. The formatting for the input file can be found in `exampleQuestions.txt`. Then, follow the prompts displayed.
